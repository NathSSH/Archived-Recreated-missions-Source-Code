# Bully Mod Scripts for and made by [SimonBestia's](https://github.com/SimonBestia/)[ Recreated missions series](https://github.com/SimonBestia/Recreated-missions-Source-Code)
## Description from [SimonBestia (the author)](https://github.com/SimonBestia/)
All the code I made for the "Recreated missions" series, except Cook's Crush and Cook's Date, as I use a lot of R* code in them.

**PLEASE NOTE**: These aren't "playable". They're basic enough for me to record them for video purposes.

Use these to learn Bully Modding. Hopefully you can get inspiration!
