## Recreated-missions-Source-Code
All the code I made for the "Recreated missions" series, except Cook's Crush and Cook's Date, as I use a lot of R* code in them.

**PLEASE NOTE**: These aren't "playable". They're basic enough for me to record them for video purposes.

Use these to learn Bully Modding. Hopefully you can get inspiration!
